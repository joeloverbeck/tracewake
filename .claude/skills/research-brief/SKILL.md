# Research Brief

Author the comprehensive, paste-ready prompt for an **external deep-research session** (ChatGPT-Pro) — here, where Claude has direct access to the whole repository — instead of reconstructing it interactively in ChatGPT-Pro.

This skill replaces **"Session 1"** of the user's two-stage routine:

- **Session 1 (replaced by this skill)**: explore the repo, interview the user to 95% confidence about their *actual* intent, then author a requirements-style prompt.
- **Session 2 (ChatGPT-Pro, the actual deep researcher)**: receives the uploaded manifest + the emitted prompt, explores and researches online as deeply as needed, and **produces the deliverable directly** — it does not re-interview.

The emitted brief is **self-contained**: ChatGPT-Pro Session 2 has none of this session's context, so everything it needs must live in the prompt plus the uploaded manifest.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT Write the brief file or refresh the manifest until BOTH hold:
(a) the interview has reached ~95% confidence (or the user issued an early-exit "just go" — in which case remaining gaps are written into the brief as explicit, labeled assumptions); AND
(b) the Step 5 brief outline + settled-intentions summary has been presented in chat and the user has approved it (silence on a section while answering other questions counts as approval; an explicit objection re-opens that section and requires re-presenting the correction first).
The skill mutates only `reports/`. It NEVER edits `docs/`, `specs/`, `tickets/`, `.claude/skills/`, or source code.
</HARD-GATE>

## Invocation

```
/research-brief "<what ChatGPT-Pro should deep-research>"   [reference_path]
```

## Step 1: Classify the research target

Read `research_target` (and `reference_path` in full if given). Classify into one type — this selects the load-bearing "read in full" set for Session 2 (the type→reads map is in `references/brief-template.md`):

- **new-spec** — what to build/create next for the repo.
- **thorny-fix** — diagnose and resolve a stubborn defect or design knot.
- **hardening / anti-contamination** — strengthen an existing system against drift, contamination, or weak proof.
- **foundational / doc-overhaul** — overhaul a doc tier (or the cascade from an upstream tier change).
- **other** — anything else; build the read set from exploration alone.

Announce the classification on its own line as your **first user-facing output**, before any exploration tool call — emit `Classification: <type>` so the audit trail records it independent of your reasoning. When ambiguous, give a one-sentence justification.

A target may carry a **dominant type plus a secondary** (e.g. a hardening pass whose deliverable is a new spec). When so, classify by the dominant type to pick the primary read-set, then union in the secondary type's load-bearing reads, and name both in the announcement (`Classification: <dominant> (secondary: <type>)`).

## Step 2: Explore the repo to ground the brief

The point of authoring here is that Claude can read the repo directly — so the *user never types out what the researcher should read*. Build, from exploration:

- the **authority-ordered read list** (`docs/0-foundation` → `1-architecture` → `2-execution` → `3-reference` → `4-specs`, then relevant `reports/`, `specs/`, `archive/`), each with a one-line reason it is load-bearing for *this* target;
- the **relevant code seams** Session 2 should inspect (name files/modules, don't paste them — Session 2 reads them itself);
- any **prior report / spec / archived work** that already bears on the target, so the brief frames the task as a delta rather than a cold start.

Launch Explore agents for broad surveys. Verify any repo claim in `research_target` or `reference_path` against the actual tree; flag contradictions prominently.

## Step 3: Light online research (optional)

Only to **sharpen scope and interview questions** — surface the named techniques, prior art, or decision axes the interview should resolve. The *deep* research is Session 2's job; do not do it here. If skipped, announce it in-session as a one-liner (e.g., "Online research: skipped — repo-internal realignment") so the audit trail is visible independent of the brief body. **The research is optional; the run-or-skip announcement is not** — emit it either way, as a peer of the Step 1 `Classification:` line.

## Step 4: Interview to 95% confidence

Reach **95% confidence about what the user actually wants** — not what they think they should want — before drafting. Display this block after each answer (or, when a batch is sent, once before the batch and once after it):

```
Confidence: X%
Gaps: [specific remaining unknowns]
```

Rules: ask one *conceptual* question at a time when probing motivation or uncertainty sequentially, where each answer reshapes the next; but batch independent, already-scoped bounded choices into a single `AskUserQuestion` call (≤4 questions). A reshaping conceptual question *may* ride in a batch with bounded ones only when the bounded options stay valid across every plausible answer to it (and you supply recommendations); if any bounded option would change meaning depending on the reshaping answer, ask the reshaping question standalone first. Prefer bounded multiple-choice (`AskUserQuestion` when available). Probe motivation before solution; challenge premature specificity; name uncertainty specifically; respect demonstrated expertise and "you decide" delegation (re-evaluate and recommend, don't re-ask). Confidence rises from both answers and exploration findings; note which gaps each closes. On receiving batched answers, re-display the `Confidence / Gaps` after-block before proceeding — unless confidence reaches threshold, in which case the "95% — drafting the brief" announcement subsumes it. Announce "95% — drafting the brief" when reached.

**Early exit**: if the user says "just go," announce current confidence, list remaining gaps, and carry them into the brief as labeled assumptions (`assumption: X`) so Session 2 — which will not ask — treats them as decisions the user can later correct.

## Step 5: Present the brief outline (HARD-GATE)

Before writing, present in chat:

1. the **settled intentions** — the resolved decisions the interview produced (these become §3 of the brief and are what make Session 2 "locked");
2. the **deliverable spec** — exactly which downloadable markdown docs Session 2 must produce (replace vs. new, filenames);
3. the **read-in-full list** (authority-ordered, with the one-line reasons).

Before presenting, confirm both audit-trail announcements were emitted earlier this run: the Step 1 `Classification:` line and the Step 3 online-research run-or-skip one-liner. If either was missed, emit it now.

Get approval (per the HARD-GATE). Revise on pushback before writing.

## Step 6: Write the brief and refresh the manifest

On approval, do BOTH:

1. **Write the brief** to `reports/<topic>-research-brief.md`, following the canonical anatomy in `references/brief-template.md`. `<topic>` is a short kebab-case slug of the target.
2. **Refresh the manifest**: write the current repository path inventory to `reports/manifest_<today>.txt`, where `<today>` is the real current date (`date +%F`) and the inventory is the exact fetch-baseline commit's tree — `git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD` (use the same `<baseline>` you pin in the brief's §1, not `git ls-files`, so the manifest provably equals the commit Session 2 fetches from). Leave any older-dated manifest in place for the user to clean; if a manifest already exists for `<today>` (e.g. from an earlier run at a different commit), regenerate it rather than trusting the stale one.

**Baseline-commit rule.** The brief instructs Session 2 to fetch every file from one exact commit, so the manifest must list exactly that commit's tree. Derive the fetch-baseline commit from verified repo HEAD (`git rev-parse HEAD`) at manifest-refresh time, and generate the manifest from that same commit (`git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD`) — do NOT use `git ls-files`, which reflects the staged index and silently diverges from HEAD under any uncommitted add/delete/rename. If you do fall back to `git ls-files`, first confirm `git status --porcelain` is clean (or reconcile every listed delta) and note the check in the Step 7 summary, since otherwise the manifest and the §1 fetch baseline will not agree. NEVER adopt a commit string copied from a report, doc, or `research_target` without confirming it contains every file in the §2 read-in-full list (`git ls-tree <commit> <path>` / `git cat-file -e <commit>:<path>`) — a "commit of record" cited inside a report is that report's *own* baseline and often predates later merges. If a referenced source cites a different commit, call out the divergence inside the brief rather than propagating it.

Resolve both paths against the worktree root if in a worktree. Do NOT commit.

## Step 7: Summarize

Report:

- the two written files (brief + refreshed manifest) — the **upload bundle** for ChatGPT-Pro Session 2;
- a one-line reminder that Session 2 is **locked / no-questions**: paste the brief, upload the manifest, and ChatGPT-Pro should produce the deliverable directly;
- any labeled assumptions carried from an early exit, so the user can correct them before pasting.

This is an inline-completion deliverable — no next-steps menu. Surface any adjacent improvement spotted during exploration as a flagged note with a concrete trigger, not as scope creep.

## Guardrails

- **Self-containment is the contract.** Session 2 has none of this session's context. Every path, decision, constraint, and acceptance check it needs lives in the brief or the uploaded manifest — never implied.
- **Claude authors; ChatGPT-Pro researches.** Don't perform the deep research here. The brief *commissions* it.
- **Locked, no questions.** The emitted brief instructs Session 2 to produce directly and NOT interview or ask clarifying questions — the interview already happened here.
- **Mutates only `reports/`.** Never touch `docs/`, `specs/`, `tickets/`, `.claude/skills/`, or source.
- **No scope inflation.** The brief commissions what was asked. Resist "while we're at it" additions to the deliverable spec.
